    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">FAQ</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Is this project affiliated with Rust?</strong> <br />
      No. This project is in no way officially affiliated with the Rust
      videogame, trademark, or Facepunch Studios.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Will this project always remain free?</strong> <br />
      Yes, this is a personal side-project of mine with no intention of
      monetization. If you don't believe me, you're always free to download the
      source code and host your own version.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How is my data stored?</strong><br />
      No data is stored on the server side. All data input is stored locally on
      your computer. For this reason, no account is needed either. As long as
      you access the application from the same computer, your info will still be
      there.
